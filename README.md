Hi! I'm `danielpancake`, a software and game developer 🫡

I create assets, systems, and games with GameMaker; build software with Rust or Tauri; and explore things like web design, data science, and functional programming

- [GameMaker Things](https://github.com/gml-assets)  
  Collection of GameMaker tools, libraries, and assets
- [Games](https://github.com/danielpancake-games)  
  Some of my open-sourced actual games

<sup>Other repos are [`here`](https://github.com/danielpancake?tab=repositories) but have yet to be categorized...</sup>
